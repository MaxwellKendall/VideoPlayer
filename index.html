                        <p>Now that we've looked at the architecture
                        of the internet, let's see how you might</p>

                        <p>connect your personal devices to
                        the internet inside your house.</p>

                        <p>Well there are many ways to
                        connect to the internet, and</p>


                        <p>most often people connect wirelessly.</p>


                        <p>Let's look at an example of how
                        you can connect to the internet.</p>


                        <p>If you live in a city or a town,
                        you probably have a coaxial cable for</p>


                        <p>cable Internet, or a phone line if you
                        have DSL, running to the outside of</p>

                        <p>your house, that connects you to
                        the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.</p>


                        <p>If you live far out in the country,
                        you'll more likely have</p>

                        <p>a dish outside your house, connecting
                        you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or</p>

                        <p>you might also use the telephone system.</p>


                        <p>Whether a wire comes straight from
                        the ISP hookup outside your house, or</p>

                        <p>it travels over radio
                        waves from your roof,</p>

                        <p>the first stop a wire will make once
                        inside your house, is at your modem.</p>


                        <p>A modem is what connects the internet
                        to your network at home.</p>

                        <p>A few common residential modems are DSL or</p>
